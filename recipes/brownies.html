    Preheat the oven to 350 F (177 C). Lightly grease and line the bottom and two sides of an 8 x 8 inch (20 cm) cake pan with parchment paper. Set aside for now. Pour the Nutella into a microwave safe bowl. Heat the Nutella spread for about 30 seconds or until warm and runny. Check the chocolate spread. If needed, allow the Nutella to cool a bit to warm. Then stir in the eggs until smooth, well combined and thickened. This takes about 1 minute of continuous stirring. Stir in the flour until just combined. Transfer the brownie batter to the prepared pan. Make sure to smooth the batter evenly into the pan. Bake the brownies for 16 - 20 minutes. The brownies are finished baking when the edges of the brownie pull slightly away from the pan and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. If the toothpick comes out with wet streaks, bake for 2 minutes and check again. Cool the brownies in the pan on top of a cooling rack for 30 minutes or until room temperature, slice and enjoy.
